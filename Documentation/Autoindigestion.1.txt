NAME
     Autoindigestion -- download iTunes Connect reports

SYNOPSIS
     Autoindigestion [options ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Autoindigestion is a command line tool for Mac OS X that downloads all
     available sales reports from iTunes Connect.  It uses the Auto-Ingest
     tool supplied by Apple to download individual reports.  Autoindigestion
     requires one or more vendor files to store iTunes Connect login creden-
     tials.

     The Auto-Ingest tool is not included with Autoindigestion but can be
     downloaded from Apple at .:
	   http://www.apple.com/itunesnews/docs/Autoingestion.class.zip

CONFIGURATION
     The following items are required to run the Autoindigestion tool:

     Autoingestion.class
	      The Auto-Ingest tool, a Java command line tool provided by
	      Apple.  Newer Macs do not have Java installed by default; you
	      may be prompted to download and install a Java runtime the first
	      time you run Autoindigestion or the Auto-Ingest tool.  Alter-
	      nately, you can download the latest Java installer from
		    http://support.apple.com/downloads/#Java
	      By default, Autoindigestion looks for Autoingestion.class in
	      "/Library/Autoindigestion".

     Vendor files
	      You need to have at least one vendor file located in the
	      Autoindigestion vendors directory.  By default, Autoindigestion
	      looks in "/Library/Autoindigestion/Vendors" for vendor files.

     A vendor file is an XML property list (.plist) file that must contain the
     following keys:

     VendorName
	      The name of the iTunes Connect vendor.  By default, this is also
	      used as the directory name for storing downloaded reports.

     VendorID
	      The iTunes Connect numeric vendor ID.  You can find this near
	      the top of the Sales and Trends page in iTunes Connect or in a
	      downloaded report file.  This is usually an eight digit number
	      like 81234567.

     Username
	      The Apple ID (an e-mail address) used to log into iTunes Connect
	      for this vendor.

     Password
	      The password corresponding to the Apple ID used to log into
	      iTunes Connect.

     A minimal vendor file looks like this:

	   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
	       "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	   <plist version="1.0">
	   <dict>
		   <key>VendorName</key>
		   <string>Example Inc</string>

		   <key>VendorID</key>
		   <string>81234567</string>

		   <key>Username</key>
		   <string>someone@example.com</string>

		   <key>Password</key>
		   <string>itsasecret</string>
	   </dict>
	   </plist>

     For more information on vendor files, see Autoindigestion(5).

     Downloaded iTunes Connect report files will be stored at
     "/Users/Shared/iTunes Connect" by default.  A subdirectory for each ven-
     dor's reports will be created in "/Users/Shared/iTunes Connect" using the
     value of the VendorName key from the vendor file.

     Autoindigestion will look for an optional configuration file at
     /Library/Autoindigestion/Configuration.plist.  This configuration file
     can be used to set the location of Autoingestion.class and the vendors
     directory.  See Autoindigestion(5) for details.

     Autoindigestion is intended to be run daily using launchd.  A launchd
     configuration plist called Autoindigestion.plist is normally placed in
     "/Library/LaunchDaemons".	See Autoindigestion(5) for a sample launchd
     file.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
     Because vendor files contain sensitive iTunes Connect user credentials,
     you should make sure to set the owner, group and mode of vendor files
     appropriately.  At a minimum, you should chmod 660 VENDORFILE to each
     vendor file so that it is only readable by its owner and group.

     The iTunes Connect user credentials are also exposed through the command
     line of the Auto-Ingest tool process, which can be viewed by any logged
     in user with the process viewing utility like ps.	Unfortunately, there
     is not currently another way to pass iTunes Connect login credentials to
     Auto-Ingest.  To mitigate this, it is recommended that each vendor create
     a separate iTunes Connect users dedicated to reporting.  This user should
     be assigned the Sales role in iTunes Connect.
