From an e-mail message sent by Apple on 31-Oct-2011:
----------------------------------------------------

Beginning on November 5, 2011, sales and trends reports downloaded from 
iTunes Connect will use a new file-naming convention:

 - The first letter of the file name will indicate whether the report is a 
   summary ("S") or daily ("D") report.

 - The second letter will indicate whether it is a weekly ("W") or 
   daily ("D") report.

 - The first two letters will be followed by the SAP vendor account number.

 - The final set of numbers will be the date stamp in "YYYYMMDD" format.

For example, if vendor account number 8123456 has a sales summary report 
for the week ending November 6, 2011, it will be represented as 
"S_W_8123456_20111106".
