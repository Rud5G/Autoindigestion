NAME
     Autoindigestion -- configuration files for Autoindigestion

DESCRIPTION
     Autoindigestion uses three different types of configuration files.  A
     vendor file is required for Autoindigestion to function.  A configuration
     file is optional.	A launchd item is also optional but recommended.

     All three file types are standard plist files.  See plist(5) for details
     on the plist format.

   Vendor Files
     A vendor file specifies the name and iTunes Connect ID of a vendor along
     with the iTunes Connect login credentials.  One or more vendor files are
     required, and by default are located in
     "/Library/Autoindigestion/Vendors".  The vendor files directory can be
     changed by the --v or ---vendors-dir command line options or by the
     VendorsDir key in the configuration file.	Vendor file names must end in
     ".plist".

   Vendor File Keys
     Vendor file values are string values except where noted.  Each vendor
     file must contain the following required keys:

     VendorName
	      The name of the iTunes Connect vendor.  By default, this is also
	      used as the directory name for storing downloaded reports.

     VendorID
	      The iTunes Connect numeric vendor ID.  You can find this near
	      the top of the Sales and Trends page in iTunes Connect or in a
	      downloaded report file.  This is usually an eight digit number
	      like 81234567.

     Username
	      The Apple ID (an e-mail address) used to log into iTunes Connect
	      for this vendor.

     Password
	      The password corresponding to the Apple ID used to log into
	      iTunes Connect.

     These keys are optional in a vendor file:

     Disabled
	      A Boolean value.	If true, all downloads are skipped for this
	      vendor.  The default is false.

     Owner    The OS X username to set as the owner of downloaded report
	      files.  If not provided, defaults to the effective user of the
	      process that runs Autoindigestion.  Overrides the Owner value in
	      the configuration file, if present.

     Group    The OS X group name to set as the group for downloaded report
	      files.  If not provided, defaults to the effective group of the
	      process that runs Autoindigestion.  Overrides the Group value
	      set in configuration file, if present.

     ReportDir
	      The absolute path for saving downloaded report files for this
	      vendor.  If not provided, defaults to
	      "/Users/Shared/iTunes Connect/<VendorName>".

   Configuration File
     The configuration file is optional.  By default, Autoindigestion looks
     for the configuration file at
     "/Library/Autoindigestion/Configuration.plist".  The location of the con-
     figuration file can be changed by the --c or ---configuration-file com-
     mand line options.

   Configuration File Keys
     Configuration file values are string values.  All keys are optional, as
     is the file itself.

     AutoingestionClass
	      The absolute path to Autoingestion.class.  If not provided,
	      defaults to "/Library/Autoindigestion/Autoingestion.class".

     VendorsDir
	      The absolute path to the directory containing the vendor files.
	      If not provided, defaults to "/Library/Autoindigestion/Vendors".

     Owner    The OS X username to set as the owner of downloaded report
	      files.  If not provided, defaults to the effective user of the
	      process that runs Autoindigestion.

     Group    The OS X group to set as the group for downloaded report files.
	      If not provided, defaults to the effective group of the process
	      that runs Autoindigestion.

   Launchd Item
     The launchd item tells OS X to run Autoindigestion automatically at a
     specified time or interval.  Launchd items are normally placed in
     "/Library/LaunchDaemons".	See launchd.plist(5) for complete information
     on what goes in a launchd item.

EXAMPLES
   Example Inc.plist -- vendor file
     A mimimal vendor file looks like this:

	   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
		   "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	   <plist version="1.0">
	   <dict>
		   <key>VendorName</key>
		   <string>Example Inc</string>

		   <key>VendorID</key>
		   <string>81234567</string>

		   <key>Username</key>
		   <string>someone@example.com</string>

		   <key>Password</key>
		   <string>itsasecret</string>
	   </dict>
	   </plist>

   Configuration.plist -- configuration file (optional)
     This configuration file overrides the default location for the Auto-
     Ingest tool and vendor files.

	   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
		   "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	   <plist version="1.0">
	   <dict>
		   <key>AutoingestionClass</key>
		   <string>/Users/Shared/iTunes Connect/Autoingestion.class</string>

		   <key>VendorsDir</key>
		   <string>/Users/Shared/iTunes Connect/Vendors</string>
	   </dict>
	   </plist>

   Autoindigestion.plist -- launchd item (recommended)
     This is a typical launchd configuration.  The Autoindigestion executable
     is located in "/Library/Autoindigestion/Autoindigestion" and is run each
     morning at 8 AM.  Standard output and standard error are redirected to
     "/Library/Logs/Autoindigestion.log".

	   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
		   "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
	   <plist version="1.0">
	   <dict>
		   <key>Label</key>
		   <string>Autoindigestion</string>

		   <key>ProgramArguments</key>
		   <array>
			   <string>/Library/Autoindigestion/Autoindigestion</string>
		   </array>

		   <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
		   <dict>
			   <key>Hour</key>
			   <integer>8</integer>
			   <key>Minute</key>
			   <integer>0</integer>
		   </dict>

		   <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
		   <string>/Library/Logs/Autoindigestion.log</string>

		   <key>StandardOutPath</key>
		   <string>/Library/Logs/Autoindigestion.log</string>
	   </dict>
	   </plist>
